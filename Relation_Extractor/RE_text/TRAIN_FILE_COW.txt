Comment:

110	"furthermore the <e1> acidosis </e1> reduces rumen motility and efficacy of mixing rumen contents which reduces the amounts of <e2> vfa </e2> near the rumen wall."

Comment: prototypical example

111	"based on the above discussion it appears prudent to begin to increase <e1> nfc </e1> in the prepartum transition period to adapt the rumen wall to <e2> vfa </e2> to feed as frequently as possible postpartum."
