cows that develop displacement of abomasum have delayed postpartum insemination (raizman and santos, 2002), which might decrease reproductive efficiency. in addition, cows with bhba ⩾ 1200 μmol/l in the first week after calving, were at 4.7 times greater risk of developing clinical ketosis. during the periparturient period, cows experience a period of immune dysregulation. after calving, when dmi is relatively low, rate of passage is slow; allowing for greater extent of fermentation and acid accumulation in the rumen. in order to increase reliability of monitoring a combination of herd monitoring tools should be used to gain an accurate report of individual farm transition cow management. reductions in liver enzymes and improvements in energy indicators such increased glucose and lower nefa and bhba suggest a possible impact on liver function and health. use a specific ration for fresh cows if possible. a number of profound physiologic changes occur in the transition cow that modifies her metabolism drastically. miettenen and setala (1993) found an increased interval from calving to conception in cows with high milk yield and high fat yield. during neb, however, the gh-igf axis uncouplesdue to a down-regulation in liver ghr and this is asso-ciated with a reduction in circulating igf-i and elevatedgh concentrations (lucy et al., 2001). underpinning principles of metabolic adaptations necessary to successfully navigate the transition from pregnancy to lactation are described, with particular emphasis on the role of amino acids. following the transition period ndf recommendations can be reduced to 26 % with 3/4 of this ndf being contributed by high quality forages (drackley, 1998). the criteria, which are informed by published scientific literature, are based on farm management and environmental factors, clinical data, milk production records, dietary analysis, and assessment of blood and liver concentrations of various metabolites or trace elements. new techniques such as functional genomics, using cdna or oligonucleotide microarrays, as well as proteomics and metabolomics, provide additional high throughput tools to determine the effects of nutrition, management, or stressors on tissue function in development of disease. these cytokines stimulatehepatic synthesis of positive acute phase proteins (papp)such as haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin (chan et al., 2004;huzzey et al., 2009). the liberated, or mobilized, nefa have one of 3 desirable fates: 1. the diagnoses, medical therapy, methods for surgical correction, and posttreatment consequences of da in an individual cow have been reported by various investigators.4–8 however, the evaluation and management of da at the herd level have not been explored as consistently. starches promote relatively greater ruminal production of propionate, which triggers insulin release that may restrain body fat mobilization. milk solids can be used if routine milk recording is practiced to look at low milk protein and high fat:protein ratios in the early lactation group (0-60dim) as an additional herd screening tool for neb. therefore, cattle are largely dependent on hepatic production of glucose from volatile fatty acids and other glucogenic precursors. as mentioned, cows experiencing tetany require immediate treatment. the secretion of buffers in the saliva is equivalent to more than 3 kg of sodium bicarbonate and 1 kg of disodium phosphate (erdman, 1988). although other low-energy ingredients might also be usable to dilute the energy of corn silage and other higher-energy feeds, no comparative data are available. if > 15 to 40% of the animals sampled (3 to 14 dim) have a bhb concentration > 1.2 mmol/l, the recommendation is to test all animals that are 3 to 9 dim twice weekly (e.g. while rumen-inert fat supplements often increase milk production for early lactation cows and may improve subsequent reproductive performance (staples et al., 1998), fat supplementation does not seem to increase milk yield until after the first few weeks of lactation (grummer, 1995). during this time, cows experience four main physiological challenges: a drop in dry matter intake, an increase in nutrient demands, immunosuppression, and systemic stress and inflammation (especially around calving). for those using the cornell net carbohydrate and protein system (cncps) version 6.1; the fetal, placental, and mammogenesis requirements for nutrients are now more dynamic and added into requirements. 7, physiological and pathological adaptations in dairy cows that may increase susceptibility to periparturient diseases and disorders

dairy cows undergo tremendous metabolic and physiological adaptations around parturition to support lactation. dairy production has capitalized on this metabolic drive by selecting for higher and higher milk production. recently, both weich et al45 and sweeney et al42,43 demonstrated both improved ca status and increased dmi and milk yield post calving for cows fed anionic diets during the dry period. hepatic lipidosis early postpartum has been linked with an extension in the postpartum anovulatory period (reist et al., 2000) and reduced reproductive performance in lactating dairy cows (jorritsma et al., 2000). it is important to understand how these factors play a role in the development of da to establish herd-level strategies to monitor and reduce the occurrence of this clinical disorder. magnesium plays a key role in the calcium homeostasis of the cow. simply using higher quality forages can have a major impact on ration energy density. in that analysis (drackley, 2003), dmi for wk 3 postpartum was not correlated with dmi prepartum, but dmi for wk 1 postpartum was correlated with dmi for wk –1 (r = 0.44, p < 0.01). fatty acids from lipolysis and amino acids from proteolysis enter the liver and can undergo different metabolic fates. a summary of research conducted on this approach worldwide provides a disappointing view of its potential to improve subsequent dmi and milk production. rumination is highly sensitive to cow well-being, and cows are able to voluntarily control rumination and have the ability to stop ruminating when disturbed. (1985) conducted a retrospective analysis of the risk factors associated with metabolic problems. these are: 1) the experimental models used to assess feeding fat; 2) the quantities of fat fed; and 3) the fatty acid profile of the dietary fats. milk fat and milk protein are significantly altered in hyperketonemia. 5, herd-level monitoring and prevention of displaced abomasum in dairy cattle

displaced abomasum is a multifactorial disorder; for this reason, veterinarians should not monitor displace abomasum alone but in association with other diseases that can lead to its development. in particular, pre and postpartum serum nefa con-centrations higher than 0.3 and 0.6 mmol/l respectively,are associated with increased risk for displaced aboma-sum, clinical ketosis, retained placenta and metritis (ospinaet al., 2010). many reports exist citing the metabolic and health problems that occur with increasing productivity (simianer et al., 1991; jones et al., 1994; emanuelson and oltenacu, 1998) and with the economic losses associated with these (drackley, 1999). subclinical hypocalcaemia is linked to immune system competence. a very comprehensive study of pit silages carried out in northern ireland (steen et al, 1998) reported huge variation in grass silage quality. the interplay between metabolic adaptation and immune function is particularly important during this period as the dietary supply of energy, protein, macro- and microminerals in relation to requirements, as well as the fatty acid balance, affect immune regulation. conclusion of intensive study in high performing herds. to be used by peripheral tissues as a source of energy; and 3. manymetabolic hormones and their receptors also alter inconcentration over the peripartum period. duffield et al (1998) reported the cumulative incidence of subclinical ketosis over the first 9 weeks of lactation in 507 untreated cows from 25 holstein dairy farms was 59% and 43% using cutoff threshold betahydroxybutyrate (bhba) concentrations of 1200 and 1400 µmol/l respectively. few studies have actually reported threshold concentrations based on either negative impacts on health, production, reproduction or culling. periparturient diseases such as milk fever, ketosis, and displaced abomasums can all be associated with poor transition (see table 1). theseresponses may correspond to the negative carryover effectsof overfeeding energy during the early dry period describedby dann and collaborators (2003). although some elevation of these metabolites is normal as these animals balance energy intake and energy demands, excessive elevation can indicate poor adaptation to neb (herdt, 2000). body condition score should ideally be maintained between 2.75 and 3.25. in brief, when the active mg transport mechanisms are blocked, such as with excessive dietary potassium, the use of soluble mg sources can increase the ruminal concentration of mg to levels that facilitate the passive absorption across the ruminal epithelium, thereby guaranteeing a sufficient mg supply (martens and schweigel 2000)

compared to hypocalcaemia and ketosis, fewer studies provide evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of the hypomagnesaemic cow. when including the costs of other diseases attributable to hyperketonemia (i.e. the objective of this review was to address the basis for and prevention of selected diseases (fatty liver, ketosis, rumen acidosis and displaced abomasums) that are feeding- and management-related and frequent in periparturient cows. it is thought that plasma nefa’s may be diag-nostic markers of impaired periparturient immunity andincreased risk of infections (moyes et al., 2009; ospina et al.,2010). the addition of nfc to the diet is necessary in the transition period but should be done gradually. a detailed review of the mechanisms of mg absorption is beyond the scope of this article and readers are referred to a recent review by goff (2018). in one study, the loss of production associated with a positive milk ketone test was 1.0 to 1.4 kg of milk per day (dohoo and martin, 1984). therefore,specific roles for methionine and lysine in aspects ofhepatic lipid and glucose metabolism remain speculativeand unsubstantiated.7. subacute rumen acidosis (sara) is also thought to be a major problem on many dairies but is difficult to measure and very little controlled research exists for this syndrome. recent philosophy has shifted the hypocalcemia focus to include management of subclinical drops in blood calcium post¬ partum. by modulating stress and inflammation after calving, the risks of developing diseases and poor performance may be decreased. the close-up diet is usually balanced according to recommendations that are halfway between the dry cow and early lactation cow and should be fed starting at least three weeks before expected calving (oetzel, 1998). however, the entire dry period is important and indeed the first 60 days after calving is also a critical window. indeed, many aspects of nutritional management (e.g., mineral nutrition beyond meeting basic nutrient requirements) appear to be much less important during the far-off period compared to the close-up period. research is needed to explore other low-energy bulky ingredients as options to straw. cows fed either ration in restricted amounts had less tg in liver on d 1 after calving, and had faster rates of dmi increase after calving. field application and testing of 1 different approaches has provided insight as well, but there is much we need to learn yet. the transition to lactation is a period of many physiological changes and a critical time to ensure cows are well prepared for a successful lactation. noticeable milk yield losses weeks prior to actual diagnosis is strong support for the negative and unrealised impact of subclinical ketosis on milk production. therefore, the risk of lactate accumulation in the rumen is high with abrupt changes from high to low fiber diets. neutrophils play an important role in the innate immune system and are rapidly mobilized and activated in response to the inflammation stimulated by an infection. moreover, the dietof most dairy cows changes sharply at calving from beingmainly forage-based to concentrate-rich diets. the standby therapy is slow intravenous administration of 500 ml of 23 per cent ca gluconate or ca borogluconate, which provides approximately 10.5 g of ca. further, it is important to continuously measure the dm and keep the tmr wet enough to be 46 to 48%. in addition, most hypomagnesaemic cows also experience some degree of hypocalcaemia and will benefit from ca administration. as demonstrated in table 1, requirements for net energy of lactation (nel) essentially double overnight as cows undergo parturition and commence lactation. it was also suggested that by increasing nfc in the diet that a greater microbial mass would be present producing more microbial protein (nocek and russell, 1988). understanding the key roleof immune responses in numerous transition cow dis-orders may help to explain links between these diverseconditions. it is now well established that dry matter intake (dmi) decreases as calving approaches. grummer (1995) demonstrated that the neb and body weight loss begins in the prepartum transition period, but that the neb is greatest in the first week postpartum. monensin significantly improved the chemotactic function of neutrophils (stephenson et al, 1996), indicating that monensin may improve immune function indirectly via an improvement in energy status. the manner in which these changes occur and how they are managed are of great importance as they are closely linked to lactation performance, clinical and subclinical postpartum diseases, and reproductive performance that can significantly affect profitability. resulting from this mobilization of lipids, we observe an increase in concentration of plasma non esterified fatty acids (nefa), which rise gradually in the prepartum transition period, but rapidly in the last 3 d of gestation. the persistency and degree of systemic regulation, as well as tissue-specific inflammation in the post-partum period and its effect on the dairy cow's productivity and health, pose an exciting and challenging field of future research, as we continue to define physiological adaptive changes during this time and improve management strategies to minimize peripartal immune dysregulation. cows with ketosis were 12 times more likely to develop displaced abomasums. avoid ration sorting. dry cows (600kg) require 6.4, 7.1 and 8.1ufl per day when housed three months prior to, two months prior to and in the last month prior to calving, respectively.these requirements assume that cows are dried off with bcs on target (see table 2). therefore, additional long-chain fatty acids provided in the diet may further imbalance the relative proportions of glucogenic and ketogenic metabolites available to the cow during the periparturient period (drackley, 1999; ingvartsen et al., 2003). we currently define dysregulation of the immune response as the inability to fight infection efficiently by mounting an adequate inflammatory response and controlling it without excessive damage to the animal. limit intermittent milking to 2-3 days. our own research (douglas, 2002; dann et al., 2003a,b; douglas et al., 2006) as well as research from others (holtenius et al., 2003) indicates that this appears to be true even if cows are not visibly overconditioned, which is well known to be detrimental (fronk et al., 1980; van den top et al., 1995). research to evaluate additional ingredient options is needed. these factors include but are not limited to adequate pen space or stall space per cow, adequate feed bunk space, sufficient and comfortable bedding, adequate water supply and minimization of heat stress. consult your veterinarian about adjusting the vaccination protocol if the cows are vaccinated at drying off. mixing of heifers who are often naïve to the adult herd endemic diseases if reared off site is a careful consideration and thus in such cases mixing of heifers well before calving or managing as a separate group until after calving could be considered. (2003) reported that supplying excessive energy to dairycows during the early dry period may have detrimental car-ryover effects during the subsequent early lactation period.while the nature of these carryover effects is not known,one could speculate that effects could be mediated throughthe metabolic machinery responsible for tissue responsive-ness to endocrine signals during the late prepartum period.results from two experiments indicated farm-specific neg-ative effects on subsequent production and health if cowswere fed the higher energy diet for the entire dry period(contreras et al., 2004) or for an average of 37 d prepar-tum (mashek and beede, 2001; mashek et al., 2002). the losses for dairy cows associated with diseases are well known, but on top of affecting the welfare of cows and economics of the farm, these conditions have a long-term effect on the productivity and fertility of cows, decreasing milk production and conception rates, and increasing culling of animals. provided that these high-straw, low-energy rations are formulated, mixed, and delivered properly, results have been positive. rukkwamsuk et al. work with your management team to develop a testing strategy to assess your level. competition for feed and space can be reduced by fenceline feeding vs bunks. the principal energy sources in a diet are carbohydrates and fat. serum concentrations of cholesterol and fas may be useful to identify cows with a metabolic abnormality or energy imbalance that might predispose them to rp and should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical risk factors such as twinning, dystocia, or parturient paresis. recent work at guelph (osborne, 2003) indicates that a dmi of less than 12 kg per cow per day in the last 3 weeks prior to calving substantially increases the subsequent risk of subclinical ketosis (odds ratio 5.7, p < 0.05). regardless, producers should be cautioned not to extend feeding of the close-up diet too long. the weight loss, fat mobilization, neb, increased plasma nefa, and liver fat accumulation is inevitable in all high-producing cows. although a detailed discussion of ca metabolism is beyond the scope of this article, multiple hormones and minerals are important for appropriate ca regulation (goff 2014); the amount of ca located in various ‘pools’ within the cow is noted in fig 3. delivery of this diet is equally important to formulating it. for nutritional management of far-off cows, we suggest examining diet formulation and aiming for 110 to 120% of metabolizable energy (me] requirements and over 1000 g/d of metabolizable protein (mp}. (2003) reported that cows fed a higher energy allowance during the dry period had a greater degree of insulin resistance before and after calving, which allowed greater nefa concentrations. the recommended bcs for dairy cows at each point of the lactation cycle is depicted in table 2. parity, season of par-turition, existence of twins or dystocia, body condition score, and vitamin e treatment were included in the model as covariates. meta-analysis stud-ies show that endometritis increases mean number of daysopen by 15 days, decreases the relative risk of pregnancyby 150 days in milk by 31% and reduces pregnancy rateby 16% (fourichon et al., 2000). cows with marginal pretreatment vitamin e status (serum α-tocopherol to cholesterol mass ratio < 2.5 × 10-3) that received an injection of vitamin e tended to have reduced risk of retained placenta. negative associations between subclinical hypocalcemia and milk production have not been reported, perhaps because higher previous lactation milk yield is a risk factor for the occurrence of milk fever. usually there is nei-ther mortality nor direct loss of milk production due toendometritis (fourichon et al., 2000). monitoring, prevention, and treatment of infectious and metabolic disorders characteristic of early lactation (eg, ketosis, retained placenta, metritis, mastitis, hypocalcemia) decreases the incidence of displaced abomasa on dairy farms. cows often fail to adapt to these metabolic and management changes, resulting in 75% of dairy cow disease incidence during the first month after calving and substantial economic losses to the dairy industry (leblanc et al., 2006). relocate the cow
maintain water access. epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between da and breed, age, parity, and season (markusfeld, 1987; constable et al., 1992). cubicle management and stocking rate is also very important in early lactation. the magnitude of the neb prepartum, therefore, appears to be a variable that can be mitigated through nutritional management. reported prevalences for hyperketonemia in the first two months of lactation have ranged from 8.9 to 34% in various studies (dohoo and martin, 1984; duffield et al, 1997). the occurrence of health problems during the transition period is clearly a major complicating factor for subsequent reproductive performance (ferguson, 2001), resulting in additional economic losses. poor transition cow management can impact all of the pillars of a successful lactation such as reduced productivity, fertility outcomes or health of the cow. vandehaar et al. thus, managing cows during the transitionperiod should be geared toward reducing neb or feeding specially formulated diets toimprove immunity. ourunderstanding of the interactions between nutrition andimmunity remains superficial. in contrast, dmi for wk 3 postpartum was correlated (p < 0.01) with percentage changes in dmi during the last 3 wk (r = 0.43) or last 2 wk (r = 0.41) prepartum. therefore, the objectives of this review article are to discuss the possible nutritional and nonnutritional factors involved in da development and provide suggestions on evaluation and management strategies at the herd level to decrease its occurrence. at the molecular level, the activation of localand systemic host defense mechanisms induce inflam-mation; furthermore, significant gene expression changesoccur as an adaptation to the demands of lactation, main-tenance and the rapidly involuting uterus. clip and wash the udder before calving. in that experiment, researchers prevented the normal drop in dmi by force-feeding the refusals into one group of cows fitted with ruminal cannulas. season of parturition and twinning were also identified as risk factors. ketone bodies serve as alternative energy sources and their increase during times of negative nutrient balance is physiological. although diet composition is important, i would argue that what we do with that diet is equally important. seven cows were used to evaluate treatment effects on ruminal fermentation and digesta kinetics. monensin treatment also significantly reduced the concentrations of serum bhba and aspartate aminotransferase, and increased the concentrations of serum glucose and urea (duffield et al, 1998a). if you noted, i said “modulating” and not “decreasing.” the reason behind this is that cows need the stress and inflammatory responses for natural processes such as parturition initiation and expulsion of the placenta. as stated before (drackley et al., 2001; drackley, 2005), continued progress in this area will depend on multidisciplinary efforts encompassing nutrition and metabolism, endocrinology, immunology, and stress physiology. therefore, timely identification and proper assistance of cows experiencing a difficult calving is critical to decrease inflammation and stress during this time. while higher-energy close-up diets were implemented enthusiastically by the dairy industry in the us, surprisingly few data are available to support their actual effectiveness in decreasing the incidence of health problems or increasing milk yield. overconditioning results in impairment of the immune system (lacetera et al., 2005) and also results in greater indices of oxidative stress (bernabucci et al., 2005). 10, the effect of prepartum injection of vitamin e on health in transition dairy cows

the objective of this study was to investigate parenteral vitamin e for the prevention of peripartum disease in dairy cows. this specula-tion is consistent with results reported recently by pickettand co-workers (2003), who measured positive effects onmetabolism and performance when ndf from forage wasreplaced by ndf from non-forage fiber sources in diets fedduring the prepartum period.however, optimal dietary concentration of the fer-mentable carbohydrates fiber, sugar, and starch is underinvestigation for the transition cows. use of glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, as a general treatment strategy for ketosis remains controversial. to be utilized by the mammary gland for milk fat synthesis; 2. leptincan influence voluntary feed intake and may also con-tribute to the peripheral insulin resistance which occursin peripartum ruminants (blache et al., 2001; ingvartsenand boisclair, 2001).plasma progesterone levels, which are high during ges-tation, fall rapidly at calving and are accompanied by atransient estrogen and glucocorticoid increase. the management practices for transition cows must be focused on maximizing dry matter intake and modulating stress and inflammation. duffield et al (2005) recently reported a cutpoint of serum calcium ≤ 1.8 mmol/l in the week following calving was associated with a significant threefold increase in early lactation culling risk. concentrations of linoleic acid in hepatic phospholipids at d 1 postpartum were more than doubled relative to controls or cows administered saturated fatty acids. collectively, these fatty acids mayhave roles important for the secretion of apolipoproteinb100 and also for vldl particle stability in cultured hepa-tocytes (wu et al., 1997). daily exercise of tied dairy cows may not affect intake. feed space is a huge issue and should be accurately measured in any dry cow accommodation. similarly, grass based dry cow diets are difficult to control mineral intake and therefore can be problematic with regards to milk fever control thus such herds with problems should consider ideally having cows three weeks indoors on a controlled ration pre-calving even if grass is utilised in the far off dry period. minimize stress, avoid overcrowding, provide a clean, dry and well ventilated environment. technology and future opportunities interest in using technology to help with on-farm transition cow decision making and early disease detection has increased in recent years. pronounced accumulation of fat in the liver with liver damage and/or reduced liver function (van den top et al., 1996) compromises, among other things, glucose synthesis. however, there were trends during the postpartum period for increased propionate concentrations and a decreased acetate: propionate ratio when sfc was fed. measuring urine ph is an essential component of monitoring prepartum dcad, and can also provide valuable information about feeding management.7,21 urine ph should be measured in midstream urine samples from approximately 12 to 15 cows weekly. high-producing dairy cows achieve greater intake by increasing meal size and spending less time eating and ruminating per unit of intake. the mobilization of lipids in the beginning of lactation is a normal and required process to help the cow meet her energy demands for lactation. in addition, sara is more likely to be a problem in component-fed rather than in tmr-fed transition cows. other key areas for monitoring include monitoring of markers of energy balance – it is advised to measure a cohort at least 10-12 or 10% of large groups of dry cows between five to 15 days pre-calving for nefa where >0.4mmol/l and bhb where > 0.7mmol/l is indicative of a problem with neb. if > 40% of the animals sampled (3 to 14 dim) have a bhb concentration > 1.2 mmol/l, the recommendation is to start treating all fresh cows with pg at 3 dim for 5 days. provide fresh water and clean waterers. however, when the increase in blood surpasses what is accepted as normal for the specific time period or stage of lactation, the animal enters a state of ketosis or more specifically hyperketonaemia (an abnormally high concentration of ketone bodies in the blood, commonly defined as bhb ≥ 1.2 mmol/l). in this way, high dmi may be more of an indicator of the overall comfort and well-being of the close-up cows rather than a cause for its success. however, it is important that practitioners understand the two main mechanisms of mg absorption. : leukosis) confirm pregnancy before drying off. a significant inverse relationship between milk fat percentage and first insemination pregnancy rates has also been identified (kristula et al, 1995). this 30 % decrease in dmi appears to occur very rapidly in the transition period. leukocytes from naturally occurringketotic cows have lower chemotactic differentials thanthose from non-ketotic cows, and chemotactic capacityis impaired when leukocytes migrate in an environmentwith ketone bodies (holtenius et al., 2004). how-ever, if the krebs cycle gets overloaded the acetyl co ais diverted to produce ketones (acetoacetic acid, acetone,and -hydroxybutyrate or bhb). unfortunately, few studies have documented prevention strategies and they consequently need to be developed based on risk factors and knowledge of the aetiology of the diseases. in contrast, cows that were limit-fed under requirements had lower nefa concentrations in the periparturient period, similar to results of douglas et al. subcutaneous administration is also acceptable for those unable to access a vein; however, time to peak ca is extended to four hours (blanc and others 2014, domino and others 2017). possible nutritional strategies to improve thehealth of the transition cowsthe primary goal of nutritional management strategiesof dairy cows during the transition period should be to sup-port the metabolic adaptations that dairy cows face duringthis period. although clinical hypocalcemia is becoming a rare occurrence on modern dairy farms employing good nutritional management strategies, sch is an often underdiagnosed problem at both the individual-animal and herd levels. in the last week of fetal development, the fetus uses an estimated 46 % of maternal glucose taken up by the uterus (bell, 1995). whatever strategy is used to feed the early lactation cow, some consideration should be given to determine if nutrient supply is meeting nutrient demands at this crucial time in the production cycle. the fat cows had an increase of 446 % blood nefa at 3 d postpartum compared to their prepartum nefa concentration, while normal cows exhibited an increase of 123 %. note that kronfeld's (1982) speculation was that dietary fat would reduce, not halt, fat mobilization. cows fed for ad libitum intake during the dry period produced about 2 kg/d less than restricted-fed cows (not significant). one possible intervention is manipulation ofenergy intake. there is a need for nutrition strategieswhich reduce susceptibility to production diseases. incidence testing of fresh cows with a cow-side blood bhba meter allows for convenient testing with accurate results and will allow herds to decide which testing and treatment strategy will be most cost effective. in most cases, with grass silage only diets this amount of pdi will be supplied. our hypothesis was that the change in dmi before calving was more highly related to postpartum dmi and fat accumulation in the liver than to the absolute dmi. 6, production-related metabolic disorders of cattle: ketosis, milk fever and grass staggers

ruminants differ from monogastrics because of the particularities of ruminal digestion of nutrients. if herd prevalence of hyperketonemia is high, accurate and timely identification of cows with hyperketonemia will allow for individual cow treatment interventions in order to decrease the risk of da, culling, poor reproduction, and low milk yield. optimum intake during the transition period will occur only if feeding management accommodates normal feeding behavior of dairy cows. the intravenous administration of tranquilizers has been associated with sudden hypotension and death and should therefore be avoided (goff 2004). the major factors at play in most transition management scenarios are stocking density, commingling of cows and heifers, frequency and number of pen moves, and heat abatement. nonetheless, overton andwaldron (2004) highlighted that the generally positiveeffects on performance and metabolism of feeding dietsduring the prepartum period that are moderately higher innfc content are linked to energy supply from carbohydraterather than nfc content of the diet per se. subclinical hypocalcemia ranges in prevalence depending on the cutpoint chosen for defining it. grain feeding increases length of the rumen papillae in comparison to feeding only poorly digestible roughages (dirksen et al., 1985). as they are already in the form of lipoproteins they can be used directly by the tissues and, theoretically, not contribute to fat accumulation in the liver. poor transition periods often result in the loss of 10 to 20 lb of peak milk (e.g., wallace et al., 1996), which could represent 2000 to 4000 lb of unrealized milk yield. at drying off, selecting cows to dry off early or cull.perform milk production planning. ideally, farm minerals are based on forage analysis and are selected based on what is complementary for the individual farm. cows fed high fermentable energy diets prepartum have improved energy balance, reduced concentrations of plasma nonesterified fatty acids and ß-hydroxybutyrate, and reduced triacylglycerol infiltration in the hepatic tissue. few published studies exist on transition period nutrition on a holistic basis. the clinical signs of tetany are observed because the decreased csf mg concentrations increase central neuronal excitability (leaver and others 1987). to achieve these low disease risks and have high milk production, there are many management areas to also monitor. excellent diet formulation and feed bunk management are critical for decreasing the drop in dry matter intake; however, if cows do not have access to the diet, these practices will be meaningless. management changes in housing, group size and movement, water availability, and post-fresh monitoring may be as important (or more important) in transition success as the diet itself. we target metabolizable protein supplies of at least 1,200 to 1,300 grams per day for cows during the close-up period. management transitions such as pen moves and ration changes are additionally occurring. a third category of metabolic disease in early lactation might include rumen acidosis, which is marked by low rumen ph. subclinical ketosis as a risk factor for subsequent disease occurrence has been linked with clinical ketosis, abomasal displacement, metritis, mastitis, and cystic ovarian disease. in a nationwide survey, it was determined that the da incidence in united states dairy herds was approximately 3.5%, with occurrence varying from 2.5% in herds with 500 or more cows to 4.8% in herds having fewer than 500 cows.1 moreover, da is known as an immediate postpartum condition with more than half of lda cases being diagnosed within 2 weeks after parturition and 80% of the lda cases occurring within the first month of lactation.2 economic analyses have determined that the average cost per da diagnosis is more than $700 when accounting for direct (eg, examination, correction, medication, discarded milk, death loss) and indirect (eg, future milk production loss, loss of body weight, decreased reproductive performance, increase risk of removal from the herd) costs.3 assuming the 3.5% incidence reported by the us department of agriculture survey with the estimated 9 million dairy cows in united states, it is reasonable to approximate that the annual losses to the dairy industry from da exceed 150 million dollars. in particular,interdependent changes occur in the gh-insulin-igf-i-glucose signaling pathway (lucy et al., 2001). cows must not be able to sort the ration, and adequate bunk space must be available. testing and monitoring options remain expensive although current studies to improve on farm, economically-viable testing methods are under way. maintenance of a healthy forage fiber mat to stimulate rumination and minimize potential for acidosis may be of large importance during the peripartal period. regardless, the continued struggle with periparturient disease highlights the need for improvements in management to allow cows to achieve their genetic potential for milk production without jeopardizing their health (and the profitability of dairy producers). in many cases, the aspects associated with the management of a group of close-up cows have become more important than the particular diet that is fed. we think that eliminating the commingling of primiparous and multiparous cows that is common during both the prepartum and post-partum periods, even on larger dairy farms, remains a major opportunity for freestall dairy farms. consider using a teat sealant. emphasis here will be placed on recent investigations in our laboratory and on hypotheses that may be worthy of future investigation. duffield (1997) established that when bhb reaches 1400 μmol/l (14.6 mg/dl) in blood, the incidence of metabolic disorders increases and when the value is above 2000 μmol/l (20.8 mg/dl) milk production begins to suffer. with lowquality grass silage or where bcs is very low at dry off (eg. the problem that our research scientists are facing is their ability to gather enough cows of similar productivity characteristics in one place to conduct the research necessary to help us to understand this animal. however, the first citation (fronk and schultz) contained no control group and the impact identified in the second study (dufva) was only marginal. walsh et al (2004) have reported that 1st service conception rate was decreased by 50% in cows with serum bhba concentrations ≥ 1400 umol/l in the 2nd week postcalving, based on 869 cows having at least one breeding postcalving. integrative approaches should be fruitful in unraveling the complex interactions of metabolism, immune activation, stress physiology, and endocrinology that likely underlie development of periparturient disease. relocate cows at least 21 days before their predicted calving date or right before labour begins. to fully interpret these studies, data are needed on whether overfeeding energy during late gestation may result in preferential accumulation of fat in internal fat depots. large variation from cow to cow within a week may indicate undesirable consumption of the ration, whether that be a result of over¬ crowding, social factors, or sorting due to poor diet mixing. the target body condition score at calving is 3.0-3.25. increas-ing the supply of glucogenic nutrients relative to lipogenicnutrients in early lactation may improve energy balance,decrease metabolic disorders, and improve reproductionthrough earlier resumption of the estrus cycle. it appears that a bolus of propylene glycol is necessary for maximum effect, since mixing in a total mixed ration is not as efficacious as either an oral drench or when mixed with a small quantity of grain (christenson et al, 1995). further, it is a known phenomenon that as dmi increases, rate of passage from the rumen increases as well. negative energy balance (neb) is a normal occurrence in dairy cattle as they transition from late gestation to early lactation. integrative approaches at the molec-ular, cellular and animal level may unravel the complex interactions between disturbedmetabolism and immune function that predispose cows to periparturient diseases. fig. clinical diseases are timely metrics to monitor on a lactational incidence basis, given that the cow is at risk for most diseases only once per fresh period. moreover, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and docosa-hexanoic acid (dha) are known to decrease the amount ofarachidonic acid in cell membranes. although the hormonal milieu will drive a certain amount of this body mobilization, excessive body catabolism is undesirable for health, reproduction, and milk production. finally, thoughts are presented on how prevention potentially could be improved in the future. cows need to be of similar body condition score, parity, expected calving dates, and genetic potential at the onset of a trial; as all of these factors will affect the outcome and the reaction of the cow to any nutritional modification. thisis compounded by additional factors such as stress ormanagement, which further reduce dmi (west, 2003;dobson et al., 2007; rhoads et al., 2009). if the low bcs is only noticed at dry off, eight weeks pre-calving, ad libitum good-quality or very good-quality grass silage is enough to increase bcs by 0.5 units (grass silage quality 72 dmd and above). however, this same diet consumed by a fresh cow can cause a severe ruminal acidosis. continuous intravenous infusion is not practical in most field situations, and may further decrease dry matter intake and is therefore not recommended. body condition score at dry-off averaged about 3.0 (5-point scale). a link between subclinical ketosis and the increased incidence of cystic ovaries has been reported suggesting an impact on ovarian function (dohoo and martin, 1984). overconditioned cows have poorer dmi after calving (fronk et al., 1980; bines and morant, 1983) and readily break down their excessive stores of body fat (reid et al., 1986; rukkwamsuk et al., 1998). a cow diagnosed with mas¬ titis is 4.2 times more likely to have another case of clinical mastitis during the subsequent lactation,34 and cows with early lactation mastitis experience decreased milk production and have a poorer pregnancy risk to first insemination.39 the average total cost for a case of mastitis in the first 30 dim is $444, with $128 in direct costs and $316 in indirect costs; the majority of indirect cost is associated with future milk loss.38 nearly 40% of cows that calve develop metritis, and multiparous cows with metritis produce less milk, have lower pregnancy risks, and are more likely to be culled than healthy cows.40 the average cost per case of metritis is estimated to be $396, with 30% due to direct costs and 70% to indirect costs.28 the average cost per case of da is estimated to be $700, with 70% due to direct costs and 30% to indirect costs.28 the high incidence and/or high cost of these post¬ partum diseases highlights the importance of minimizing disease incidence for both individual animal health and herd profitability. therefore management practices for periparturientdairy cows should be geared toward optimizing feed intake,particularly dry matter.5.1.2. however,the increased milk output has been accompanied by adecline in fertility in many countries. cows evenshow typical inflammatory changes prior to calving (trevisiet al., 2002; trevisi and bertoni, 2008). moreover, if the prepartum transition diet is too low in energy, the neb will be large leading to the other risk factors for da as discussed previously. considerable emphasis has been placed in recent years on increasing the starch content of close-up or pre-fresh groups (grummer, 1995; minor et al., 1998; vandehaar et al., 1999). consequently, feeding management designed to mitigate a decline in dmi prepartum and rapidly increase dmi postpartum will reduce the risks associated with da. as sufficient magnesium (mg) concentrations are required for proper interaction of parathyroid hormone with its receptor, adequate blood mg concentration is also important for ca regulation. nevertheless, a few comments on various aspects of this topic in relation to the periparturient physological or pathophysiological changes are warranted. gong (2002)showed that feeding a higher starch diet (26% vs. 10%) increased blood insulin concentration in early lactationand increased the proportion of cows that ovulated withthe first 50 d postpartum. furthermore, nfc fermentation will produce more propionic acid; thereby increasing the supply of glucose precursors and minimizing the use of glycogen reserves normally observed in the transition period. this monitoring scheme should continue until at least 2 consecutive prevalence tests independently result in fewer than 40% of the animals testing positive. this may be partially due to thedecreased dmi associated with higher body condition dur-ing the prepartum period (hayirli et al., 2002). integrativeapproaches at the molecular, cellular and animal level tounravel the complex interactions of metabolic and immunefunction underpinning periparturient diseases are warran-ted. however, in cows with adequate serum vitamin e, there was no reduction in the incidence of any disease. 50% of cows at bcs 2.5 and less), the option exists to dry off cows early, especially in years of low milk price. other studies in which supplemental fat was fed at more typical levels before calving also show no responses in dmi or milk production (skaar et al., 1989; allen et al., 1995; salfer et al., 1995; burhans and bell, 1998). assuming that higher producing cows are more likely to be hyperketonemic, a larger proportion of subclinically ketotic cows combined with misclassification bias of clinical ketosis cases could mute any association between clinical ketosis and previous lactation milk yield. protein and amino acid nutrition. offering feed in the calving area and close up accommodation is useful in milk fever control ensuring the cow has feed in front of her at all times. one can further speculate that if more glucose precursors are available in the form of propionate, then fewer amino acids will be used for gluconeogenesis in supplying energy to the cow. correa et al (1993) found that ketosis increased the risk of abomasal displacement, but not the reverse. however, leptin concentrations remain lowpostpartum even when the energy balance has improved(ingvartsen and boisclair, 2001; wathes et al., 2007). therefore, there is a resulting increase in plasma nefa at calving. it is difficult to determine whether the negative effect of triacylglycerol infiltration in the hepatic tissue on postpartum resumption of ovarian cycles is direct, or just a consequence of negative energy balance. presumably the early lactation risk was associated with reduced. thus, it is vital that the level of potassium in the dry cow diet is understood – which requires mineral analysis of forages. precalving oral treatment with 300 g of propylene glycol per day for 10 days lowered serum non-esterified fatty acid (nefa) concentrations and improved some measures of reproductive performance in one study (formigoni et al, 1996). the effects of impairedimmune responses in lda are unknown. as genomic technologies progress, we have the increasing ability to utilize these technologies to identify sires that are high immune responders and offer improved adaptation to the metabolic challenges of the transition period. however, it is imperative to minimize these. we must make all attempts to maximize dmi, increase the energy density of the diets without sacrificing rumen function, and maintain bcs near recommended levels at this critical time. little research as focused specifically on the relationships among feeding behavior, management strategy, and optimal intake by the transition cow. often producers will record disease or disease treatments on-farm; however, the recording of only disease treatments rather than the disease state can be problematic in that this may be underreporting the true disease incidence or an overestimation of disease incidence if each episode of treatment is recorded as a disease event. this can be given as a bolus (most commercial products contain between 40 to 60 g of ca) or via an oral drench of 500 g ca propionate (table 2). furthermore, the acidosis reduces rumen motility and efficacy of mixing rumen contents, which reduces the amounts of vfa near the rumen wall. the relationship between displaced abomasum and ketosis has been identified as bi-directional. good grazing management is necessary to have an idea what the grass availability is and what is actually being eaten in order that the correct supplementation level is offered. it is not uncommon to find a ketotic cow also having problems with fatty liver and displaced abomasum. estimates indicate it costs at least $78 us (geishauser et al, 2001) (and probably closer to $350 cdn), which considered at the herd level, is considerably more than most clinical diseases, since subclinical disease is far more frequent. additionally, the neb and resulting increase in plasma nefa, if sufficiently high, contributes to the development of fatty liver; which itself is a contributing factor to other health problems in the postpartum period (grummer, 1995; dyk and emery, 1996). dairy cows undergo tremendous adaptive changes during the transition from late gestation to early lactation. strategies to prevent these diseases are therefore based on major factors directly or indirectly increasing the risk of fatty liver, ketosis, acidosis and displaced abomasum—factors such as over-conditioning at calving, excessive mobilisation of body fat, low nutrient intake, nutrient or diet specific factors and management and environmental stress. administration of a monensin controlled release capsule precalving reduced the incidence of clinical ketosis by 50%, abomasal displacement by 40% and multiple illness by 40% (more than one disease) (duffield et al, 1999b). earlier research also supports this concept (kunz et al., 1985). one recent study showed possible beneficial effects of using dexamethasone in addition to propylene glycol in raising glucose and insulin concentrations and lower ing bhb concentrations in 31 ketotic cows with low feed intake and milk production postpartum (van der drift and others 2015). although subclinical and clinical ketosis are both part of the same continuum, we can only assume the associations found for clinical ketosis would be the same for the subclinical condition. although cows will experience some degree of immunosuppression during this time regardless of management, an exacerbated stressful and/or inflammatory response may magnify this immunosuppression, increasing the risk of cows developing diseases. grass silages are extremely variable in their major nutritional qualities. thus, calcium homeostasis, energy balance, and rumen ph are important considerations for disease prevention in transition dairy cows (goff and horst, 1997). during the dry period, cows generally consume a diet that is principally composed of forages and, by consequence, is more fibrous than the type of diet offered in lactation. however recent work seems to be building a consensus that there is a negative impact. there are many opportunity areas to implement management practices mitigating the risk of early lacta¬ tion catabolic armageddon. however, the fact that, on average, roughly one in every two to three cows calving succumbs to some health problem during the transition period (e.g., jordan and fourdraine, 1993; duffield et al., 2002) underscores the fragility of the system. as i mentioned in one of my previous articles (barragan 2020a), the transition period is one of, if not the, most challenging period for dairy cows during their production cycle. the nutritional factors include ndf content and digestibility and nfc content and fermentability, in both the pre- and postpartum diets. relationships between prepartum and postpartum dmi and the accumulation of lipid in the liver after calving were analyzed (drackley, 2003) using cows from a previous data set (douglas, 2002; douglas et al., 2004, 2006). thus, pdi balances should be calculated based on the farm specific forage(s) used in the dry cow diet, it is likely that supplementary protein may be required for dry cow diets containing straw, low-protein forages such as maize silage or low pdi grass silages. when producers are struggling with transition-related health problems and the close-up management program is addressed, often more than just diet is changed. it has been proven that when dairy cows calve down in an over-conditioned state (bcs 4.0, scale 1-5) they have a higher level of bcs loss post-calving, a compromised metabolic state, and a reduced feed intake in early-lactation in comparison to cows with an appropriate bcs at calving (bcs 3.25, scale 1-5) at calving (alibrahim et al, 2010). this period is aptly named. if we think about the drop in intake and the increase in nutrient needs, the main negative effects are animals going into a negative energy balance (because they are using more nutrients than what they are consuming) and developing metabolic diseases such as ketosis and fatty liver. we recently used a dose of 500 ml (250 g)in a randomised controlled study of 34 postpartum cows suffering from hyperketonemia, and did not document any detrimental consequences on intensively monitored parameters of metabolism when giving this bolus at the higher dose range over three days once per day (mann and others 2017). the questionable nutritional impact of the close-up group has been underscored again by a recent experiment from our laboratory, in which cows (n = 36 to 38 per group) had essentially equal dmi and milk production after calving when fed the same closeup diet at either ad libitum intake or in restricted amounts sufficient for only 80% of calculated precalving nel requirements (dann et al., 2003b). when fat mobilization is high and the liver is reesterifying nefa into triglyceride it cannot produce vldl fast enough to export the fat and accumulation begins. table 3 summarises the factors affecting the absorption of mg in the reticulorumen. ionophores have been proposed as potential prophylactic agents for reducing hyperketonemia. 6, improving energy supply to late gestation and early postpartum dairy cows

sixty-five multiparous holstein cows were used to test the effects of feeding diets of varied ruminal carbohydrate availability during the transition period on dry matter intake, blood metabolites, and lactational performance. a dysregulated immune system increases susceptibility to infection, and retained placenta, metritis, and mastitis can result. ruminal acidosis is also a frequent problem for cows at the beginning of lactation, because of highly fermentable rations and insufficient rumen adaptation (slow passage rates) to these rations. mertens (1997) created a system to determine the effectiveness of ndf to stimulate rumination and to maintain milk fat concentrations. treatment of hyperketonemic cows with pg will decrease the risk of negative subsequent health events, improve reproduction, and, in some herds, will improve milk production, assuming that sck is the primary limitation for these outcomes. this acidosis, even at the subclinical level, will cause a reduction in cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen and contribute to an overall reduction in feed digestibility. monitor body condition once a month. it is necessary to mention here that these disorders are interrelated and that the conditions conducive to the development of one problem in one category can lead to a disorder in another category.  culling the influence of subclinical ketosis on the risk of culling has not been well described. much of the emphasis has been on maximizing pre-calving energy intake by 2 pushing for higher dry matter intakes (dmi) and increasing diet energy density through greater rates of concentrate feeding. ros can initiate lipid peroxidation andcause cellular damage to tissues. reducing the dietary cation anion difference [dcad; na + k - cl - s = meq/100 g dm) of the prepartum ration is a tried and true method for decreasing rates of clinical milk fever.316 strategies for implementing this approach can range from minimizing the dietary potassium [aiming for a low but still positive dcad) to varying inclusion rates of anion supplements to reach a negative dcad. the recommendations for nfc for prepartum transition cows is 30 to 35 % of total dietary dm (shaver, 1993). although the latter is efficacious it needs to be closely monitored for efficacy through regular urine ph checking. while comparison to external benchmarks is inherently dangerous to sound decision making, we aim to provide a framework such that a dairy can begin to internally calibrate its management metrics. however, this has not been observed in canadian studies when other serum constituents, including ketones, have been evaluated (geishauser et al, 1997; leblanc et al, 2005). it is not unusual for a high producing cow in the first 100 d in milk (dim) to consume 22 kg of dm/d, of which more than half is in the form of concentrates, without posing any particular problems to the cow if the diet is well balanced. consistent definitions of disease state and reliable recording of these events over time are necessary to appropriately monitor the health of the herd. control flies and parasites. to maintain ca concentrations at a level required for life (eg, thermoregulation, muscle contraction) while transferring a large quantity to colostrum and milk, cows increase the secretion of parathyroid hormone which increases release of ca from bone, decreases ca excretion by the kidney, and indirectly increases intestinal absorption of ca via vitamin d-dependent means. metabolic disorders associated with energynutrition3.1. there is a lack of published studies that have established cutpoints in this way for subclinical hypocalcemia. particularly in large herds, computer recording of transition cow disease events can facilitate timely monitoring of the herd's health and action for individual cows. because dmi of cows may decline by 10 to 30% during the last 7 to 14 d before calving, it has been assumed that increased nutrient density may allow maintenance of the same intake amounts of key nutrients such as protein despite lower total dmi. too high a content of nfc predisposes a cow to acidosis, reducing dmi; too low a content prepartum will also predispose cows to acidosis postpartum; too much ndf will also limit dmi (mertens, 1994). clearly the role of inflam-matory responses in the decline in fertility is not known,given the range of effects on various physiological pro-cesses. the term transition is to underscore the important physiological, metabolic, and nutritional changes occurring in this time frame. obesity leads to increased susceptibility to the complex of metabolic disorders and infectious diseases known as the "fat cow syndrome" (morrow, 1976). some recognised targets for disease incidence are included in table 1. using rumination monitoring data can help modify traditional fresh cow examinations with less disturbance of cows, decreased time in headlocks, less labor, and more focus on high-risk cows. there are many non-nutritional modulators that affect dmi (mertens, 1994; rosseler, 1993). high nutrient demands for galactopoesis are accompanied with mobilization of bodyreserves to support milk production. rumen acidosis when acid production in the rumen resulting from fermentation of organic matter exceeds the capacity for the animal to absorb these acids or be neutralized, ruminal ph falls. because of the positive effects on lipid metabolism, diets high in nonfibrous carbohydrates increased concentrations of liver glycogen and reduced concentrations of hepatic triacylglycerol. nevertheless, diets that minimize the risk for hepatic lipidosis and ketosis are expected to improve postpartum energy balance and resumption of cyclicity. assuming that management of post-parturient cows is satisfactory, a thinner cow should have a better appetite after calving than a heavier cow. milk protein percent has been reported to be lower in cows with subclinical ketosis (miettenan and setala, 1993). therefore, there may be an advantage to modulating inflammation after calving. however, most of the mg of an animal is located outside of the extracellular fluids (fig 3) and even though bone stores a significant proportion of the body’s mg, it cannot be used in times of mg deficit because bone resorption takes place in response to ca status, not mg. serum αtocopherol was significantly increased in treated cows at 7 and 14 d, but not at 21 d after injection. many of the practices described above may modulate stress and inflammation to some degree; however, there are specific practices around calving that may have a greater effect. cows with postpartum ketosis have lower circulating concentrations of glucose than herdmates (mann and others 2016b). in adult ruminants, the reticulorumen is the main site for mg absorption (martens and rayssiguier 1980, martens and gabel 1986). we must recognize that adipose tissue can synthesize fat (use lipoproteins to make fat) and mobilize nefa (hydrolyze body fat). however, for diets based on grass silage and straw fed in restricted amounts, improvements in milk protein concentration were noted in early lactation following supplementary protein feeding in the dry period (murphy, 1999). during early lactation, increased feeding frequency of a total mixed diet may most improve intake when dietary fermentability is moderate to high and management quality is poor. however, due to many factors, including those previously mentioned, the metabolic processes do not adjust sufficiently and a disequilibrated metabolism leads to many of the typical problems associated with transition cows. when nfc present in the rumen increases abruptly and rapidly, the production of vfa increases proportionately (owens et al., 1998). however, without objective measures for ketosis, the definition might vary widely in observational studies such as this. this, coupled withthe low prevailing insulin, provides an endocrine environ-ment that promotes the direct action of gh on lipolysis andgluconeogenesis in early lactation.leptin is another metabolic hormone of interest inrelation to energy balance. however, management or environmental circumstances that force cows away from their optimal body condition (i.e., too thin, too fat) may result in increased risk for health problems (ingvartsen et al., 2003). the goals of the transition diet (specifically designed to prevent subclinical ketosis) are to maximize dry matter intake and to provide adequate energy density (oetzel, 1998). in herds where potassium in the forage exceeds 2.5% of dry matter, a separate milk fever control strategy should be in place. feeding steam-flaked corn prepartum decreased apparent fiber digestibility and ruminal nh3 n. feeding steam-flaked corn postpartum decreased the acetate to propionate ratio. it has been speculated that feeding supplemental fat would reduce fatty acid mobilization from body stores and reduce liver fat accumulation (kronfeld, 1982). rumen protected choline has been shown to influence liver glycogen and triglyceride (pipenbrink and overton, 2003), but not in all studies (zahra, 2004). endometritisclinical endometritis is the inflammation of the uteruswithout systemic illness, characterized by purulent ormucopurulent discharge or a cervical diameter > 7.5 cmafter 20 days postpartum (dim), or mucopurulent dis-charge after 26 dim (leblanc et al., 2002). hypocalcemia increases the risk of da (massey et al., 1993) probably because of the role of calcium in muscular tonicity. caution is advised when formulating early lacta-tion diets to stimulate the recrudescence of ovarian activitysince highly fermentable starch diets fed immediately aftercalving may decrease dmi and prolong neb (allen et al.,2009).6.2. our objectives are to provide practical guidance, based on available research and field experience, in defining nutritional requirements for the pregnant cow relative to proper feeding management strategies and second, integrate other factors that may deter herd transition performance to ensure that a greater percentage of cows successfully complete this critical adaptation period. this information can be used to improve feeding and management strategies to increase transition cows energy nutrition of close-up cows. the objective of this article is to summarize the current research base and provide some recommendations based on research and field experiences. the lactate producing bacteria increase in numbers rapidly as the amount of nfc in the diet increases, but the lactate-utilizing bacteria adapt more slowly (3 to 4 wk). although it is unlikely that dry period nutrition per se causes metabolic disorders, certain nutritional factors certainly appear to predispose cows to health problems. to minimize a predisposition of cows to ketosis and fatty livers it is necessary to avoid excessive weight loss in the pre- and postpartum transition period by minimizing the magnitude of the neb. the typical decrease in dmi before calving results in the need to increase contents of crude protein and nel by about 2 percentage units and 0.20 mcal/kg of dm, respectively, in the close-up diet. risk factors such as neb, inflammation and impairment of the immuneresponse are highly cause-and-effect related. we believe that there will be significant advances in our understanding of the nutritional needs of the cow during the immediate post-partum period during the next 5 years. 1. hansen (2000) suggested that continued selection for high milk production along with concurrent selection for larger mature size and more angular appearance may have increased the susceptibility to digestive and metabolic disorders such as displaced abomasum and ketosis. while prevention of neb is beyond the scope of this review, controlled-energy dry cow diets and feeding of monensin have been found to lessen neb and help cows transition more smoothly into lactation. according to his data, fiber sources are classified according to their ability to stimulate rumination, which was directly related to the size of particle and suggested that lactating holstein cows should receive diets containing at least 21% physically effective ndf in order to maintain milk fat content above 3.5%. diets contained the same calculated energy density (nel of 6 mj/kg) and were either high fat (4% of dm) or control.
