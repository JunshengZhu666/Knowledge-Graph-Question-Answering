cows fed ad libitum consumed about 157% of nrc (1989) nel requirements for dry cows and restricted cows were offered only enough feed to meet 80% of nrc recommendations. force-fed cows had greater plasma glucose concentrations 2 d before calving and less liver triglyceride accumulation at 1 d after calving and tended (p < 0.11) to produce more 3.5% fat-corrected milk (46.1 vs. 41.7 kg/d) during the first 28 d of lactation. hypocalcemia increases the risk of da (massey et al., 1993) probably because of the role of calcium in muscular tonicity. similarly, multiparous cows, regardless of calving difficulty, that were treated with this anti-inflammatory drug had lower systemic inflammation and produced almost 4 pounds per day more milk during the first 60 days in milk compared to cows that were not treated (barragan et al., 2020c). the criteria, which are informed by published scientific literature, are based on farm management and environmental factors, clinical data, milk production records, dietary analysis, and assessment of blood and liver concentrations of various metabolites or trace elements. after cessation of milking, is important for maintaining the health and productivity of transition cows (dann et al., 2006). cows fed either ration in restricted amounts had less tg in liver on d 1 after calving, and had faster rates of dmi increase after calving. feeding sfc postpartum also reduced nefa concentrations. a subsequent canadian study conducted in 45 dairy herds confirmed that monensin crc reduces the incidence of displaced abomasum (duffield et al, 2002). transition cow nutrition and management have received much attention in the research and popular-based literature in recent years because of the recognition of its importance in the productivity and health of cows. the energetic demands of gestating cows reach 1.3 to 1.5 times the maintenance requirements by the end of gestation (quigley and drewry, 1998). as they are already in the form of lipoproteins they can be used directly by the tissues and, theoretically, not contribute to fat accumulation in the liver. at parturition, cows were assigned to a postpartum total mixed ration that contained either cracked corn or steam-flaked corn. poor transition cow management can impact all of the pillars of a successful lactation such as reduced productivity, fertility outcomes or health of the cow. for holsteins, this is in the range of 16 to 18 mcal/day of nel. during both the prepartum and postpartum transition period cows require more energy than they are able to consume resulting in the neb and the concomitant loss of body weight (condition) to supply the necessary energy even in healthy cows (bell, 1995). reÂ¬ search in post-partum systemic inflammatory response and the effects on health and productivity in transition dairy cows has yet to clarify to what extent and persistency inflammation should be considered a normal adaptive response.4 from a management perspective, overcrowding, comingling of fresh heifers and mature cows, competition at the feedbunk, excessive pathogen pressure, heat stress, and stressful handling situations all affect the ability of the transition cow's immune system to adequately react to infectious challenges. however, the lack of repeatable success with close-up dry period nutrition programs in decreasing the occurrence of health disorders and increasing subsequent milk production has been frustrating and problematic to farmers, nutritionists, and researchers (drackley, 1999). rogers and hope-cawdery (1980) first described the beneficial effects of monensin for reducing the incidence of ketosis in a herd with a clinical ketosis problem. sequence of offering feeds may affect intake, but relative degradabilities of dietary protein and starch need to be considered. grummer (1995) demonstrated that the neb and body weight loss begins in the prepartum transition period, but that the neb is greatest in the first week postpartum. for example, milk fever or subclinical hypocalcemia can lead to loss of muscular tonicity resulting in an increased risk of retained placenta and/or displaced abomasums, in spite of retained placenta being classified as a problem related to the immune system. close-up diets seem to have proven beneficial in the field in many situations. provide access to the ration 23 hours out of 24. monensin included at 30 grams per ton of total ration (high group), decreased the incidence of subclinical ketosis and significantly reduced blood bhba levels in the first three weeks postpartum (sauer et al, 1989). cows fed for ad libitum intake during the dry period produced about 2 kg/d less than restricted-fed cows (not significant). however, difficulty arises if either the pdin or the pdie value of grass silage is less than 60g/kg of dm. (2003) reported that cows fed a higher energy allowance during the dry period had a greater degree of insulin resistance before and after calving, which allowed greater nefa concentrations. we can then use these tools to improve breeding decisions and select for traits that optimize transition cow health and immune competence. in brief, when the active mg transport mechanisms are blocked, such as with excessive dietary potassium, the use of soluble mg sources can increase the ruminal concentration of mg to levels that facilitate the passive absorption across the ruminal epithelium, thereby guaranteeing a sufficient mg supply (martens and schweigel 2000)

compared to hypocalcaemia and ketosis, fewer studies provide evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of the hypomagnesaemic cow. rukkwamsuk et al. identification of an objective level where nefa and/or bhb are excessive and cause detrimental effects on health, reproduction and milk production, has been difficult due to individual animal variations, normal metabolite elevations during the transition period, and the multiple herd level factors that can affect the outcomes of interest. to be used by peripheral tissues as a source of energy; and 3. kauppinen subsequently reported that subclinically ketotic cows had significantly higher annual milk yields than nonketotic cows. glucose demands can exceed the gluconeogenic capacity of the liver; for example, in the immediate postpartum period, when the need for glucose supply for lactose production rises quickly. often, addition of water or another wet ingredient to decrease the ration dry matter into the 46 to 48% range is also required for optimal effectiveness of these rations. a severe neb in the transition period can aid in the development of metabolic diseases, prolong the interval between calving and first ovulation and decrease fertility. serum concentrations of cholesterol and fas may be useful to identify cows with a metabolic abnormality or energy imbalance that might predispose them to rp and should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical risk factors such as twinning, dystocia, or parturient paresis. (1992). however, the transition cow is likely to be in a state of lipolysis predominantly because of her energy balance status and her hormonal profile (low insulin and high cortisol) that does not favor body fat deposition. however, the accumulation of these compounds can lead to ketosis (2). evidence for this phenomenon includes the classic study by garnsworthy and topps (1982) and our own recent data (douglas et al., 2006), showing that cows that are forced away from their desired body condition (either fatter or thinner) before calving eventually converge to a similar body condition score by 4 to 8 wk after calving. recent advances in understanding of production diseases include the emergence of propylene glycol and rumen protected choline as the supplements of choice for preventing fatty liver and the absence of any preventative effect of increased energy density in the close-up dry period diet on this condition; the linear negative influence of dietary cation anion difference (dcad) on the incidence of milk fever regardless of urinary ph or the target level of dietary dcad achieved; the inflammatory response associated with subacute rumen acidosis and its effect on feed intake; an increased awareness of the potential for antioxidant status to improve immunity and health in the transition period; the development of more standardised diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols for uterine infection. the weight loss, fat mobilization, neb, increased plasma nefa, and liver fat accumulation is inevitable in all high-producing cows. hansen (2000) suggested that continued selection for high milk production along with concurrent selection for larger mature size and more angular appearance may have increased the susceptibility to digestive and metabolic disorders such as displaced abomasum and ketosis. as an example, thin vs. obese dry cows will have different dynamics in fat metabolism, dmi patterns, and nutrient needs both pre- and postpartum. while comparison to external benchmarks is inherently dangerous to sound decision making, we aim to provide a framework such that a dairy can begin to internally calibrate its management metrics. however, feeding cows four times a day can be logistically complex in a farm setting, and the recommendation is to deliver fresh feed at least two times a day, ideally three, for this group of animals. this method has given us a deeper understanding of the problems faced by these cows, but has also led to some confusion in interpreting data. a randomized clinical trial was conducted in 21 commercial dairy herds. this could be 2kg of a dry cow nut, 2kg of barley or 3kg of maize silage or whole crop-wheat silage. another proposed benefit of additional grains in the prepartum diet is to adapt the ruminal tissues and the rumen microbial population to the type of diet that will be fed after calving (goff and horst, 1997). while implementation of close-up diets has been adopted enthusiastically by the dairy industry in the north america, surprisingly few data are available to support their actual effectiveness in decreasing the incidence of health problems or increasing milk yield. group cow relocations to only take place once a week. ketone bodies serve as alternative energy sources and their increase during times of negative nutrient balance is physiological. at drying off, selecting cows to dry off early or cull.perform milk production planning. oral calcium products differ in their chemical composition and biological availability. intravenous and even subcutaneous ca can result in a rebound hypocalcaemia 24 hours after administration (box 1), and thus repeated administration of intravenous or subcutaneous ca are counterproductive (blanc and others 2014, domino and others 2017). most of what is suggested to optimize future fertility is related to relationships between metabolic disorders and risk for delayed conception. subclinical hypocalcaemia is linked to immune system competence. however, it is imperative to minimize these. cows fed a tmr with sfc during the last 4 wk of gestation consumed more energy than cows fed a tmr with cc. cow-level risk factors are parity, body condition score and season of calving. stocking density. the current working hypothesis under investigation in our laboratory is that extended periods of feeding diets high in starch and/or total energy to dairy cows during late gestation induce changes analogous to insulin resistance in other species, even in the absence of visible overconditioning. thus, the requirement for concentrate in the dry cow diet of most irish cows (ca 5,000l of milk, 400kg f and p) should be driven primarily by concerns about bcs and silage quality. elevated concentrations of bhba were associated with da, clinical ketosis and culling. major minerals, trace elements and vitamins are also important and the dry cow diet should include a specific dry cow mineral. thus, monitoring and managing dairy herds to decrease the incidence of da is of extreme importance for the sustainability of dairy production and to improve animal health and wellbeing. in one of our studies, we found that cows that experienced a difficult calving had an elevated inflammatory response in the days after calving, and subsequently, a higher risk of developing diseases compared to cows that experienced a normal calving. if the herd is thin in late lactation (eg. it is also interesting to note that nrc (2001) advocate a 70% increase in energy density in the close-up dry cow diet. when nfc present in the rumen increases abruptly and rapidly, the production of vfa increases proportionately (owens et al., 1998). when sampled in the appropriate time frame, pre- and post-partum nefa and bhb concentraÂ¬ tion above certain thresholds are associated with negative downstream outcomes such as increased risk of disease, and decreased milking and reproductive performance at the individual cow level. commingling primiparous and multiparous cows. ketosis has been shown to significantly reduce milk yield in dairy herds (12,13). dry matter intake regulation of dmi during the periparturient period is complex and largely not understood (ingvartsen and andersen, 2000; grummer et al., 2004). the gluconeogenic potential of monensin has attracted researchers to investigate its possible role as an antiketogenic agent in dairy cattle. monensin significantly improved the chemotactic function of neutrophils (stephenson et al, 1996), indicating that monensin may improve immune function indirectly via an improvement in energy status. these factors include but are not limited to adequate pen space or stall space per cow, adequate feed bunk space, sufficient and comfortable bedding, adequate water supply and minimization of heat stress. bulky rations with the forage base consisting of either straw or mature, low-potassium hay blended with corn silage and a grain mix can be easily sorted by cows if the straw or hay is not chopped, ideally prior to mixing into the tmr. consequently, feeding management designed to mitigate a decline in dmi prepartum and rapidly increase dmi postpartum will reduce the risks associated with da. these results stand in contrast to the documented benefits of fat supplementation, particularly of rumen-inert fats, during established lactation (staples et al., 1998). calving monitoring and proper assistance, along with mild anti-inflammatory treatment, can be beneficial to modulate stress and inflammation after calving and decrease the losses associated with this period. the liberated, or mobilized, nefa have one of 3 desirable fates: 1. in order to increase reliability of monitoring a combination of herd monitoring tools should be used to gain an accurate report of individual farm transition cow management. negative energy balance (neb) is a normal occurrence in dairy cattle as they transition from late gestation to early lactation. even with subclinical ketosis, there is a loss of 1-1.5kg/day of milk production (2). the first key area, already addressed, in the control of milk fever is the control of body condition score, maintaining bcs in the desired range at calving is a fundamental point in preventing milk fever. although some elevation of these metabolites is normal as these animals balance energy intake and energy demands, excessive elevation can indicate poor adaptation to neb (herdt, 2000). diets were fed until 63 d in milk. when producers are struggling with transition-related health problems and the close-up management program is addressed, often more than just diet is changed. test day milk production was negatively correlated with milk acetone levels in several scandinavian projects. production diseases of the dairy cow are caused by a level of production inconsistent with nutrient intake, provision of an inadequate diet, an unsuitable environment, an inappropriate breeding policy or various combinations of these factors. it has been said that âthere is very little new under the sunâ. in addition, cows with nefa concentrations â©¾ 1.0 mmol/l were 3.6 times more likely to be culled within the following 2 months. the principal energy sources in a diet are carbohydrates and fat. other methods exist to increase energy intake by pre-fresh cows. for example, we (douglas et al., 2002) infused soybean oil into the abomasum of cows for 40 d before expected parturition. resulting from this mobilization of lipids, we observe an increase in concentration of plasma non esterified fatty acids (nefa), which rise gradually in the prepartum transition period, but rapidly in the last 3 d of gestation. herds vary also in their ability to detect and react to changes in each of these areas, which also contributes to their degree of overall success in transition period management. opportunities to improve transition cow management hypocalcemia, neb, and immune dysfunction are related; while all occur to some extent during the transition period, our goal as managers is to minimize the severity and duration of these states. field experiences have been varied; in some cases, changes in close-diets have resulted in apparent improvements in health or productivity, but in other cases results have been frustrating (drehmann, 2000). other studies have shown 3 no differences in postpartum responses to widely differing nutrient intakes during the close-up period (e.g., kunz et al., 1985; dewhurst et al., 2000; holcomb et al., 2001; agenas et al., 2003; rabelo et al., 2003). cows fed steam-flaked corn had lower blood urea n concentrations during the prepartum period and lower plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations during the prepartum and postpartum periods. mixing of heifers who are often naÃ¯ve to the adult herd endemic diseases if reared off site is a careful consideration and thus in such cases mixing of heifers well before calving or managing as a separate group until after calving could be considered. monitoring criteria are described for each of these key areas, which when considered collectively, will facilitate the assessment of dairy cow health with regard to clinical and subclinical disease. no more than 10% of cows 0-60 in milk should have milk fat: protein >1.5 and no more than 10% early lactation cows should have a milk protein <3.05. finally, thoughts are presented on how prevention potentially could be improved in the future. in addition, microarray analysis of gene expression patterns revealed extensive differences in hepatic gene expression between overfed and underfed cows (loor et al., 2004). the requirement for the development of rumen papillae and to acclimatise rumen microbes for dry cows coming off a grass silage-based diet and receiving 4kg or less of concentrate feed in a grazing scenario, is unlikely to be significant, if bcs is on target. reducing the dietary cation anion difference [dcad; na + k - cl - s = meq/100 g dm) of the prepartum ration is a tried and true method for decreasing rates of clinical milk fever.316 strategies for implementing this approach can range from minimizing the dietary potassium [aiming for a low but still positive dcad) to varying inclusion rates of anion supplements to reach a negative dcad. 50% of cows at bcs 2.5 and less), the option exists to dry off cows early, especially in years of low milk price. however, in cows with adequate serum vitamin e, there was no reduction in the incidence of any disease. detailed recommendations for nutrition during the dry period can be found elsewhere (oetzel, 1998). to fulfil the glucose needs as well as other nutrient requirements, the physiological adaptation of the cow allows for alternative sources of energy and amino acids to be used that stem from adipose and muscle tissue breakdown. magnesium supplementation is also important; 20-25g of supplemental magnesium is often required in silage-based dry cow diets. to achieve these low disease risks and have high milk production, there are many management areas to also monitor. minimize stress, avoid overcrowding, provide a clean, dry and well ventilated environment. using rumination monitoring data can help modify traditional fresh cow examinations with less disturbance of cows, decreased time in headlocks, less labor, and more focus on high-risk cows. validate with penn state. work with your management team to develop a testing strategy to assess your level. starches promote relatively greater ruminal production of propionate, which triggers insulin release that may restrain body fat mobilization. thus, pdi balances should be calculated based on the farm specific forage(s) used in the dry cow diet, it is likely that supplementary protein may be required for dry cow diets containing straw, low-protein forages such as maize silage or low pdi grass silages. it appears that a bolus of propylene glycol is necessary for maximum effect, since mixing in a total mixed ration is not as efficacious as either an oral drench or when mixed with a small quantity of grain (christenson et al, 1995). when implemented correctly, these diets have been successful in decreasing incidences of peripartal health disorders. in our experience, commonly used doses of bolus infusion range from 250 to 500 ml of 40 to 50 per cent glucose (total of 125 to 250 g). clinical ketosis is defined as a concentration greater than 35 mg/dl. accuracy and consistency in feed delivery and composition are paramount to a successful transition feeding program. when fat mobilization is high and the liver is reesterifying nefa into triglyceride it cannot produce vldl fast enough to export the fat and accumulation begins. because of this difficulty, we have used animals outside of this short time frame and tried to simulate the same conditions that exist in the true transition cow. therefore, the clinical signs will not disappear until the csf mg concentration increases, usually about 1 hour after the iv administration of mg because the blood-brain barrier decreases the diffusion of mg. during this time, it is important not to stimulate the animals to rise in order to avoid the initiation of a tetany episode. research results have been mixed in terms of feeding fat to transition cows; where some show a benefit and others do not (skaar et al., 1989; grum et al., 1996; douglas et al., 1998; bertics and grummer, 1997). macromineral nutrition to improve calcium status. (1992). this article will focus primarily on the importance and prevention aspects of subclinical ketosis. although the transition period of 3 weeks pre-calving until 3 weeks post-calving is associated with a peak incidence of production disease, the effects of these diseases on dairy cow health and productivity extend far into the following lactation. additionally, the neb and resulting increase in plasma nefa, if sufficiently high, contributes to the development of fatty liver; which itself is a contributing factor to other health problems in the postpartum period (grummer, 1995; dyk and emery, 1996). the typical decrease in dmi before calving results in the need to increase contents of crude protein and nel by about 2 percentage units and 0.20 mcal/kg of dm, respectively, in the close-up diet. walsh et al (2004) have identified reductions in fertility starting at a cutpoint of 1100 umol/l and duffield et al (2005) have identified increased culling risk at 1400 umol/l bhba. the recommendations for nfc for prepartum transition cows is 30 to 35 % of total dietary dm (shaver, 1993). if the ration is changed abruptly at calving the capacity of the rumen flora to metabolize lactate, the principal acid responsible for acute rumen acidosis, is at a minimum at the initiation of lactation. we think that eliminating the commingling of primiparous and multiparous cows that is common during both the prepartum and post-partum periods, even on larger dairy farms, remains a major opportunity for freestall dairy farms. the economic impacts of maladaptation are important and include increased risk of metabolic disease, reduced milk production, early removal from the herd, and poor reproductive performance. in that experiment, researchers prevented the normal drop in dmi by force-feeding the refusals into one group of cows fitted with ruminal cannulas. while higher-energy close-up diets were implemented enthusiastically by the dairy industry in the us, surprisingly few data are available to support their actual effectiveness in decreasing the incidence of health problems or increasing milk yield. as the acid accumulation continues more severe problems can occur with dmi and production as well as with overall health (schultz et al., 1993). conclusions and clinical relevanceâthese associations indicated that prepartum energy metabolism contributes to the development of rp. evaluate the option of using the rumensin bolus with your veterinarian. there can be an average loss of production of 25% or 353.4kg per lactation (10,13) with clinical ketosis. proceduresâserum concentrations of fatty acids (fas), Î²-hydroxybutyrate, cholesterol, glucose, urea, and calcium and blood leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil counts were determined. in adult ruminants, the reticulorumen is the main site for mg absorption (martens and rayssiguier 1980, martens and gabel 1986). correa et al (1993) found that ketosis increased the risk of abomasal displacement, but not the reverse. the intravenous administration of tranquilizers has been associated with sudden hypotension and death and should therefore be avoided (goff 2004). the questionable nutritional impact of the close-up group has been underscored again by a recent experiment from our laboratory, in which cows (n = 36 to 38 per group) had essentially equal dmi and milk production after calving when fed the same closeup diet at either ad libitum intake or in restricted amounts sufficient for only 80% of calculated precalving nel requirements (dann et al., 2003b). body condition score should ideally be maintained between 2.75 and 3.25. in addition, cows with bhba â©¾ 1200 Î¼mol/l in the first week after calving, were at 4.7 times greater risk of developing clinical ketosis. reist et al (2003) used milk acetone at 0.4 mmol/l and serum bhba at 2300 umol/l and found significantly reduced milk yield at both cutpoints and increased the risk of endometritis at the milk acetone threshold. if herd prevalence of hyperketonemia is high, accurate and timely identification of cows with hyperketonemia will allow for individual cow treatment interventions in order to decrease the risk of da, culling, poor reproduction, and low milk yield. the normal concentration of plasma ketones (using bhb as an indicator) is less than 10 mg/dl. in general, these are difficult areas in which to conduct controlled research because of the need for replicated pen designs if studying group-housed cows for many factors. the reason for the equivocal nature of this long-held assumption is that if nfc is not increased, the rumen wall is not prepared for the abrupt increase in concentrates postpartum which will increase the risk for da (shaver, 1998). control flies and parasites. one of the major areas of focus by cook and nordlund was the issue of the number of pen moves made during both the prepartum and post-partum periods.8 in many freestall transition management systems, it is not uncommon for cows to make 5 to 6 moves during the 6-week period around calving. cows were housed individually in tiestalls during the dry period. for example, a round hay feeder with an 8-foot diameter and 18 sections will allow 15 cows to eat at the same time. high-straw, low-energy rations are exciting for their potential to markedly improve health during the transition period. hypocalcemia results when serum calcium concentration falls faster than homeostatic mechanisms can adapt to the demands of lactation. energy during the transition period; therefore, has a major impact on cow performance and longevity. it is a common recommendation to divide the dry period into two feeding groups: far-off and close-up (radostits et al, 1994). poor transition periods often result in the loss of 10 to 20 lb of peak milk (e.g., wallace et al., 1996), which could represent 2000 to 4000 lb of unrealized milk yield. several options are available to reduce the rate of relapses (table 4). therefore, there may be an advantage to modulating inflammation after calving. this poses an enormous challenge for the liver that has to synthesize all of this glucose from propionate and amino acids as well as a challenge for other tissues and organs that have to adapt to a reduction of glucose availability. 2, managing the challenges in transition dairy cows

abstract the transition from late gestation to lactation is a period of many physiological changes, and a critical time to ensure cows are well prepared for a profitable and healthy lactation. in most cases, with grass silage only diets this amount of pdi will be supplied. rumen acidosis when acid production in the rumen resulting from fermentation of organic matter exceeds the capacity for the animal to absorb these acids or be neutralized, ruminal ph falls. dohoo & martin (1984) could find no direct association between the two conditions. difficulties with pdi provision will also arise where straw or low protein forages might be included in the diet of the dry cow. the transition period is commonly accepted as the period from three weeks pre to three weeks post calving. if these vfa are not absorbed rapidly they will accumulate in the rumen (schultz et al., 1993). in that experiment, researchers prevented the normal drop in dmi by force-feeding the refusals into one group of cows fitted with ruminal cannulas. this combination creates a negative energy balance. the end of pregnancy and the beginning of lactation; therefore, represent a time when there is a massive increase in need for glucose. although immediate therapy is imperative to prevent progression to death, it is important to note that additional ca is required to counter the ca deficit until the cow returns to normal feed intake. feeding a high nonfirbrous carbohydrate diet prepartum increased dry matter and energy intake, which improved energy balance of cows throughout the transition period. however, data from burke et al (2010) for new zealand dairy cows indicates that feeding nonfibrous carbohydrate in the late pregnant dairy cow diet had no effect on reproduction in grazing dairy cows. milk fat and milk protein are significantly altered in hyperketonemia. with regard to feed delivery frequency, research has shown that when performed often, up to four times a day, this practice will stimulate cows to go to the feed bunk and eat. typically, far-off diets follow nrc guidelines for dry cows. although each of these ideas by themselves were sound and based on good research data, the ability of higher-energy close-up or âsteamupâ diets to minimize production diseases in research trials and field experience has been disappointing and frustrating. the objective of this review was to address the basis for and prevention of selected diseases (fatty liver, ketosis, rumen acidosis and displaced abomasums) that are feeding- and management-related and frequent in periparturient cows. key areas of management to optimize post-partum health, production, and reproduction dairy herds vary widely in the degree to which they achieve success in maintaining excellent health, both in terms of clinical and subclinical health disorders, high milk yield during early lactation, and return to estrous cycling with high fertility in the post-partum period. feeding management of dry cow rations. prepartum and postpartum treatments did not affect digesta kinetics. in general, subclinical disease incidence is more common than clinical disease. 4, methods of measurement and implications of abnormal calcium concentrations in fresh dairy cows

hypocalcemia is a prevalent disorder in the early postpartum period. if grass silage quality is poor, cows may lose bcs in the dry period. post-partum nutritional strategies and fresh cow diets. use a specific ration for fresh cows if possible. whitaker et al (1993) found cows with a better energy status at 14 days postpartum had a reduced interval from calving to the onset of cyclicity and fewer services per conception. high potassium, as is found in many grass silages, is implicated in the dietary cation anion difference (dcad) or in simple terms high potassium induces a state of metabolic alkalosis. 2.0) concentrate supplementation may be required for dry cows. the study indicated that early post-partum serum bhba, nefa and ca concentrations have potential as indicators of disease and culling risk in dairy cows. the antiketogenic properties of monensin were later investigated in a canadian trial involving two levels of monensin and three groups of 12 holstein cows (sauer et al, 1989). thin cows have been proven to have a significantly increased risk of lameness, uterine health issues and retained foetal membranes. we believe that the degree of success relates directly to the net effects of an integrated and dynamic set of factors that include nutritional management [both ration formulation and implementation), facility characteristics, grouping management, and overall cow/herd management. duffield et al (1998) reported the cumulative incidence of subclinical ketosis over the first 9 weeks of lactation in 507 untreated cows from 25 holstein dairy farms was 59% and 43% using cutoff threshold betahydroxybutyrate (bhba) concentrations of 1200 and 1400 Âµmol/l respectively. it is possible that higher milk yields put cows at increased risk of developing subclinical ketosis. the losses for dairy cows associated with diseases are well known, but on top of affecting the welfare of cows and economics of the farm, these conditions have a long-term effect on the productivity and fertility of cows, decreasing milk production and conception rates, and increasing culling of animals. however, there is no doubt that hormonal and other physiological factors have the most important impact on this phenomenon. for the postpartum transition period the recommendations are in the order of 28 to 32 % ndf in the total dm (hutjens, 1995; drackley, 1998). in herds where potassium in the forage exceeds 2.5% of dry matter, a separate milk fever control strategy should be in place. the mobilization of lipids in the beginning of lactation is a normal and required process to help the cow meet her energy demands for lactation. serum nefa and bhba concentrations during week 1 were associated with the subsequent occurrence of clinical ketosis. subacute rumen acidosis (sara) is also thought to be a major problem on many dairies but is difficult to measure and very little controlled research exists for this syndrome. relapses are common, and cows should receive further treatment within 12 hours. to maximize dry matter intake, diet composition â especially fiber and energy concentrations âis one of the most critical factors. dry off or cull cows that are lame, have high scc or that are disease carriers (e.g. we could have the best formulated diet with the best ingredients, but if cows do not have access to it, the diet composition would be irrelevant. bhb concentrations can be measured qualitatively or quantitatively with several tests of varying sensitivities and specificities both cow-side or in laboratories. feeding steam-flaked corn prepartum decreased apparent fiber digestibility and ruminal nh3 n. feeding steam-flaked corn postpartum decreased the acetate to propionate ratio. walking the farm, measuring feed space, looking at the cows, body condition scoring is very important. although not common, the ucd herd health group have encountered problems where occasionally some farms may feed the same mineral to milking and dry cows inadvertently or push the milking cow total mixed ration (tmr) in to dry cows, this is important to look at, as the level of calcium for example will be entirely different and can be very dangerous with regard to milk fever control. limit intermittent milking to 2-3 days. thus, it is vital that the level of potassium in the dry cow diet is understood â which requires mineral analysis of forages. although diets high in nonfibrous carbohydrates improve energy status of transition cows, provision of adequate amounts of physically effective ndf is important to maintain rumen fill, thereby helping in the prevention of displacement of abomasum. concentration of plasma progesterone, which is high in gestation, rapidly falls at calving and there is a transitory elevation in estrogens and glucocorticoids in the periparturient period. health outcomes across studies also provide little evidence for marked improvement.
